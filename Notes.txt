Once you have installed all the packages that your project needs, you can run:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

pip freeze is “freezing” all the packages/versions currently being used. Then you are piping (i.e., saving) the output of pip freeze via a txt file.

Other people using your program will then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

and be able to install all the packages and the correct versions in one go. Amazing right? 🚀
